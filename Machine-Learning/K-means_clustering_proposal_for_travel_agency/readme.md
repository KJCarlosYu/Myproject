This project is conducted based on the platform "Dataiku", using k-means clustering and agglomerative & interactive clustering to understand the trip organized by customers.

We found out 4 different types of trips from the dataset, including family weekend trips, family long vacations, peer trips and business trips.

My job consisted of conducting the k-means clustering analysis, analyzing the characteristics of each cluster and assigning category for each.
