This project is a machine learning project used to predict the rent of the apartments in madrid.

The dataset includes data of the apartments, including the square meters, district, bedroom numbers, whether there is elevator or not, etc.

It consists of 3 parts:

1. data cleaning (done with python)
2. model developing and comparison (done in dataiku)
3. conclusions (business ideas and presentation)

I took part in all the 3 parts, collaborating with different group mates.
